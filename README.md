# Book Lover - Track Your Books

We love to read books, but at the same time, it gives satisfaction when we can complete a good book. A book can really help us in many different ways. 
But then we forget our learnings. 

What if you could track down your favorite books? What if you could have a library of the books you read or want to read in the future? 
What if you could refer to some important lessons you learned from a book 10 years ago? 
What if you could write down your feelings when you were overwhelmed reading a marvelous book? 
What if you could choose a book based on real feedback from real book lovers?
